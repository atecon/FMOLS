Description: Fully Modified Least Squares Estimation for I(1) variables

Help text:

This function carries out Fully Modified Least Squares (FMLS)
estimation. It is essentially a transalation (with permission) of the
Gauss procedure FMPROC included in the suite COINT 2.0, by
S. Ouliaris and P.C.B Phillips.

Input parameters
    y: series, Dependent variable
    x: list, Right Hand Side I(1) variables

    k1: scalar, the highest integer power of time to be included in
    the regression equation (default = 0)

    k2: scalar, the highest integer power of time which is believed to
    be describing the stochastic process of the regressors x (default= 1)

    whiten: boolean, perform VAR(1) pre-whitening when calculating
    covariances (default=1)

    kernel: scalar. 1 = Quadratic Spectral kernel, 2 = Parzen kernel,
    3 = Bartlett kernel (default = 1)

    band: scalar, bandwidth for covariance calculation. The special
    value 0 triggers Andrews' (1991) automatic bandwidth selection.
    A VAR(1) model is used to calculate the automatic bandwidth.

Output: a bundle containing
    b1: FM estimates of the coefficients on the regressors x
    b2: FM estimates of the coefficients on the trend regressors
    v:  FM covariance matrix for the vector (b1 b2)
    u:  FM residuals.
