This function carries out Fully Modified Least Squares (FMLS) estimation.
It is essentially a translation (with permission) of the Gauss procedure
FMPROC included in the suite COINT 2.0, by S. Ouliaris and P.C.B Phillips.

The only public function is FMOLS() which has the following arguments:

FMOLS(const series y, const list x, const bundle opts[null])
==================================================================

Input parameters
    y:     series, Dependent variable
    x:     list, Right Hand Side I(1) variables
    opts:  bundle, Pass user-specific parameters (optional)


Return: Bundle holding various information; see below.


The FMOLS() function is executed with some default parameter values.
The user, however, can overwrite the following parameters by passing the
'opts' bundle:
==============================================================================
type_deterministic:
            string, Select the deterministic to be included.
                    Options are:
                    "c": include a constant (default)
                    "ct": include a constant and linear trend
                    "ctt": include a constant, linear and quadratic trend

type_dgp_x:
            string, Select the deterministic which is believed to be
            describing the stochastic process of the regressors "x".
            Options are:
                    "c": include a constant (default)
                    "ct": include a constant and linear trend
                    "ctt": include a constant, linear and quadratic trend

do_prewhite:
            boolean, Perform VAR(1) pre-whitening when calculating
            covariances of 1 (=TRUE), otherwise not.

prewhitening_lag:
            int, Lag-length of the VAR(p) for pre-whitening (default p=1)

type_kernel:
            string, Select the kernel method. Options are:
                     "quadratic": Quadratic Spectral kernel (default)
                     "parzen": Parzen kernel
                     "bartlett": Bartlett kernel
bandwidth:
           scalar, Bandwidth for covariance calculation. The special value
           -1 triggers Andrews' (1991) automatic bandwidth selection. A
           VAR(1) model is used to calculate the automatic bandwidth.

verbose:
           boolean, Print any output if 1 (=TRUE) (default), otherwise not.


The returned bundle contains:
=============================
    bhat_coint: FM estimates of the coefficients on the regressors x
    bhat_deter: FM estimates of the coefficients on the deterministic regressors
    se_coint:   FM std. errors of the coefficients on the regressors x
    se_deter:   FM std. errors of the coefficients on the deterministic
                regressors
    vcv:        FM covariance matrix for the vector (bhat_coint bhat_deter)
    uhat:       FM residuals
    T:          Number of valid observations used
    ystar:      "Cleaned" endogenous
    name_endogenous: Name of the dependent variable
    names_xlist: String array of the exogenous
