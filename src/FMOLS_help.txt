This function carries out Fully Modified Least Squares (FMLS) estimation.
It is essentially a translation (with permission) of the Gauss procedure
FMPROC included in the suite COINT 2.0, by S. Ouliaris and P.C.B Phillips.

The only public function is FMOLS() which has the following arguments:

FMOLS(const series y, const list x, const bundle opts[null])
==================================================================

Input parameters
    y:     series, Dependent variable
    x:     list, Right Hand Side I(1) variables
    opts:  bundle, Pass user-specific parameters (optional, see below)


Return: Bundle holding various information; see below.


The FMOLS() function, both in scripting and GUI mode, is executed with some
default parameter values.
In GUI mode these can be overridden using the pull-down menus, and in scripting
mode by passing the 'opts' bundle:
==============================================================================
type_deterministic:
    string, Select the deterministic which is believed to be
    describing the stochastic process of the endogenous.
    Options are:
        "c": include a constant (default)
        "ct": include a constant and linear trend
        "ctt": include a constant, linear and quadratic trend

type_dgp_x:
    string, Select the deterministic which is believed to be
    describing the stochastic process of the regressors "x".
    Options are:
        "nc": x is assumed to be I(1) with no drift (differences of x have zero
              mean)
        "c":  x is assumed to be I(1) with drift (differences of x have non-zero
              mean) (default)
        "ct": x is assumed to be I(1)  with a trending drift (differences of x
              have a trend)

do_prewhite:
    boolean, Perform VAR(1) pre-whitening when calculating covariances if 1
    (=TRUE), otherwise not.

type_kernel:
    string, Select the kernel method. Options are:
        "quadratic": Quadratic Spectral kernel (default)
        "parzen": Parzen kernel
        "bartlett": Bartlett kernel
bandwidth:
   scalar, Bandwidth for covariance calculation. The special value -1 triggers
   Andrews' (1991) automatic bandwidth selection. A VAR(1) model is used to
   calculate the automatic bandwidth.

verbose:
   boolean, Print any output if 1 (=TRUE, default), otherwise not.


The returned bundle contains:
=============================
    coeff:      matrix, Estimates of the estimated (by FMOLS) long-run
                coefficients
    stderr:     matrix, Standard error of the coefficients
    pvalue:     matrix, P-values of the estimated coefficients
    vcv:        matrix, Square matrix containing the estimated covariance matrix
                for the coefficients
    sigma:      scalar, Standard error of the regression
    df:         int, Degrees of freedom
    uhat:       series, Estimated FMOLS-based residuals which are defined as
                uhat(t) = y(t) - x(t)*b where b is the vector of long-run
                coefficients
    yhat:       series, Fitted values
    T:          int, Number of valid observations used
    t1:         int, Index of the initial observation used for estimation
    t2:         int, Index of the last observation used for estimation
    depvar:     string, Name of the dependent variable
    parnames:   strings, Array of names of the exogenous variables
    names_xlist: String array of the exogenous
    aic:        scalar, Akaike information criteria
    aicc:       scalar, corrected Akaike information criteria
    bic:        scalar, Schwarz information criteria
    hqc:        scalar, Hannan-Quinn information criteria
    bandwidth:  scalar, value of (automatically selected) bandwidth
